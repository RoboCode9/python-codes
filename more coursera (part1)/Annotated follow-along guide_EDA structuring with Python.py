# # Annotated follow-along guide: EDA structuring with Python

# This notebook contains the code used in the following instructional video: [EDA structuring with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/go-beyond-the-numbers-translate-data-into-insight/lecture/Pf6KW/eda-structuring-with-python)

# ## Introduction
# 
# Throughout this notebook, we will practice structuring data in Python. Before getting started, watch the associated instructional video and complete the in-video question. All of the code we will be implementing and related instructions are contained in this notebook.

# ## Overview
# 
# In this notebook, we will examine lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) for the year of 2018. To complete this notebook, we will:
# 
# * Find the locations with the greatest number of strikes within a single day
# * Examine the locations that had the greatest number of days with at least one lightning strike 
# * Determine whether certain days of the week had more lightning strikes than others  
# * Add data from 2016 and 2017 and, for each month, calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes for that year that occurred in that month
# * Plot this data on a bar graph

# ## Import packages and libraries
# 
# Before getting started, we will need to import all the required libraries and extensions. Throughout the course, we will be using pandas for operations, and matplotlib and seaborn for plotting.

# In[1]:


# Import statements
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import datetime
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


# ### Organize the data

# In[2]:


# Read in the 2018 data.
df = pd.read_csv('eda_structuring_with_python_dataset1.csv') 
df.head()


# Just like the data you encountered previously, this dataset has three columns: `date`, `number_of_strikes`, and `center_point_geom`. Start by converting the `date` column to datetime. 

# In[3]:


# Convert the `date` column to datetime.
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']) 


# Now, let's check the shape of the dataframe. 

# In[4]:


df.shape


# Check for duplicates. If the shape of the data is different after running this code, you will know there were duplicate rows.

# In[5]:


df.drop_duplicates().shape


# The shape of the dataset after dropping duplicates is the same, so you can assume there are no duplicates. Hence, there is at most one row per date, per area, and per number of strikes. 

# ### Locations with most strikes in a single day

# To identify the locations with the most strikes in a single day, we will sort the `number_of_strikes` column in descending value, or by most to least strikes.

# In[6]:


# Sort by number of strikes in descending order.
df.sort_values(by='number_of_strikes', ascending=False).head(10)


# ### Locations with most days with at least one lightning strike
# 

# To find the number of days that a given geographic location had at least one lightning strike, we will use the `value_counts()` function on the `center_point_geom` column. The logic is that if each row represents a location-day, then counting the number of times each location occurs in the data will give you the number of days that location had lightning. 

# In[7]:


# Identify the locations that appear most in the dataset.
df.center_point_geom.value_counts()


# The locations with the most days with lightning strikes had at least one strike on 108 days—nearly one out of every three days of the year. These locations are all rather close to each other geographically. Notice also that the `value_counts()` function automatically sorts the results in descending order. 
# 
# Now we will examine whether there is an even distribution of values, or whether 108 strikes is an unusually high number of days with lightning strikes. We will use the `value_counts()` function again, but this time we will output the top 20 results. We will also rename the columns and apply a color gradient.

# In[8]:


# Identify the top 20 locations with most days of lightning.
df.center_point_geom.value_counts()[:20].rename_axis('unique_values').reset_index(name='counts').style.background_gradient()


# ###  Lightning strikes by day of week

# One useful grouping is categorizing lightning strikes by day of the week, which will tell us whether any particular day of the week had fewer or more lightning strikes than others. To calculate this, we will take advantage of the fact that the data in our `date` column is of the `datetime` class. Because these entries are datetime objects, we can extract date-related information from them and create new columns.
# 
# First, we will create a column called `week` using `dt.isocalendar()` on the `date` column. This function is designed to be used on a pandas series, and it will return a new dataframe with year, week, and day columns. The information is formatted numerically; for example, January 3, 1950, would be represented as:
# 
# | Year | Week | Day |
# | ---- | :--: | :-: |
# | 1950 | 1    | 3   |
# 
# Because we only want to extract the week number, we will add `.week` to the end. You can learn more about `dt.isocalendar()` in the [pandas.Series.dt.isocalendar documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.isocalendar.html).
# 
# We will also add a `weekday` column using `dt.day_name()`. This is another pandas function designed to be used on a pandas series. It extracts the text name of the day for any given datetime date. You can learn more about this function in the [pandas.Series.dt.day_name documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.day_name.html).
# 

# In[9]:


# Create two new columns.
df['week'] = df.date.dt.isocalendar().week
df['weekday'] = df.date.dt.day_name()
df.head()


# Now, we can calculate the mean number of lightning strikes for each weekday of the year. We will use the `groupby()` function to do this.

# In[10]:


# Calculate the mean count of lightning strikes for each weekday.
df[['weekday','number_of_strikes']].groupby(['weekday']).mean()


# It seems that Saturday and Sunday have fewer lightning strikes on average than the other five weekdays. We will plot the distributions of the strike counts for each day of the week. We want each distribution to be represented as a boxplot. 
# 
# We will begin by defining the order of the days, starting with Monday and ending with Sunday. This is how the days will be ordered in the plot we create.

# In[11]:


# Define order of days for the plot.
weekday_order = ['Monday','Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday']


# Now, we will code the plot. Remember that `showfliers` is the parameter that controls whether or not outliers are displayed in the plot. If we input `True`, outliers are included; if we input `False`, outliers are left off of the box plot. Keep in mind, we aren’t *deleting* any outliers from the dataset when we create this chart—we are only excluding them from the visualization.

# In[12]:


# Create boxplots of strike counts for each day of week.
g = sns.boxplot(data=df, 
            x='weekday',
            y='number_of_strikes', 
            order=weekday_order, 
            showfliers=False 
            );
g.set_title('Lightning distribution per weekday (2018)');


# Notice that the median remains the same on all of the days of the week. As for Saturday and Sunday, however, the distributions are *both* lower than they are during the rest of the week. We also know that the mean numbers of strikes that occurred on Saturday and Sunday were lower than on the other weekdays. Why might this be? Perhaps the aerosol particles emitted by factories and vehicles increase the likelihood of lightning strikes. In the U.S., Saturday and Sunday are days that many people don't work, so there may be fewer factories operating and fewer cars on the road. This is only speculation, but it's one possible path for further exploration. 

# ### Monthly lightning strikes 2016–2018

# Finally, we will examine monthly lightning strike data from 2016–2018. We will calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes for each year that occurred in a given month. We will then plot this data on a bar graph.

# In[13]:


# Import 2016–2017 data
df_2 = pd.read_csv('eda_structuring_with_python_dataset2.csv')
df_2.head()


# The data is in the same format as the 2018 data when we imported it previously. Now, we will convert the `date` column to datetime.

# In[14]:


# Convert `date` column to datetime.
df_2['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_2['date'])


# Now we can combine the 2016–2017 dataframe with the 2018 dataframe. There are several functions that can do this. We will use `concat()`. Remember that the 2018 data has two added columns: `week` and `weekday`. To simplify the results of our combined dataframe, we will drop these added columns during the concatenation. Note that the following code doesn't permanently modify `df`. The columns drop only for this operation. You can learn more about the `concat()` function in the [pandas.concat documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.concat.html).

# In[15]:


# Create a new dataframe combining 2016–2017 data with 2018 data.
union_df = pd.concat([df.drop(['weekday','week'],axis=1), df_2], ignore_index=True)
union_df.head()


# To help us name the bars of the bar plot, we will create three new columns that isolate the year, month number, and month name. 

# In[16]:


# Add 3 new columns.
union_df['year'] = union_df.date.dt.year
union_df['month'] = union_df.date.dt.month
union_df['month_txt'] = union_df.date.dt.month_name()
union_df.head()


# Let's check the overall lightning strike count for each year.

# In[17]:


# Calculate total number of strikes per year
union_df[['year','number_of_strikes']].groupby(['year']).sum()


# Now we will calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes that occurred in a given month for each year and assign the results to a new dataframe called `lightning_by_month`. 

# In[18]:


# Calculate total lightning strikes for each month of each year.
lightning_by_month = union_df.groupby(['month_txt','year']).agg(
    number_of_strikes = pd.NamedAgg(column='number_of_strikes',aggfunc=sum)
    ).reset_index()

lightning_by_month.head()


# We can use the `agg()` function to calculate the same yearly totals we found before, with 2017 having fewer strikes than the other two years.

# In[19]:


# Calculate total lightning strikes for each year.
lightning_by_year = union_df.groupby(['year']).agg(
  year_strikes = pd.NamedAgg(column='number_of_strikes',aggfunc=sum)
).reset_index()

lightning_by_year.head()


# In our bar plot, we need to use the monthly totals to calculate percentages. For each month, we will need the monthly total strike count and the total strike count for that year. Let's create another dataframe called `percentage_lightning` that adds a new column called `year_strikes` which represents the total number of strikes for each year. We can do this using the `merge()` function. We will merge the `lightning_by_month` dataframe with the `lightning_by_year` dataframe, specifying to merge on the `year` column. This means that wherever the `year` columns contain the same value in both dataframes, a row is created in our new dataframe with all the other columns from both dataframes being merged. To learn more about this function, refer to the [pandas.merge documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.merge.html).
# 

# In[20]:


# Combine `lightning_by_month` and `lightning_by_year` dataframes into single dataframe.
percentage_lightning = lightning_by_month.merge(lightning_by_year,on='year')
percentage_lightning.head()


# Now we will create a new column in our new dataframe that represents the percentage of total lightning strikes that occurred during each month for each year. We will do this by dividing the `number_of_strikes` column by the `year_strikes` column and multiplying the result by 100.

# In[21]:


# Create new `percentage_lightning_per_month` column.
percentage_lightning['percentage_lightning_per_month'] = (percentage_lightning.number_of_strikes/
                                                          percentage_lightning.year_strikes * 100.0)
percentage_lightning.head()


# Now we can plot the percentages by month in a bar graph.

# In[22]:


plt.figure(figsize=(10,6));

month_order = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 
               'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

sns.barplot(
    data = percentage_lightning,
    x = 'month_txt',
    y = 'percentage_lightning_per_month',
    hue = 'year',
    order = month_order );
plt.xlabel("Month");
plt.ylabel("% of lightning strikes");
plt.title("% of lightning strikes each Month (2016-2018)");


# For all three years, there is a clear pattern over the course of each year. One month stands out: August. More than one third of the lightning strikes in 2018 happened in August.
